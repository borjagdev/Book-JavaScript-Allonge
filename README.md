# Following JavaScript Allongé, the "Six" Edition
## Introduction
This repository is a compilation of tested examples I made following the book *[JavaScript Allongé, the "Six" Edition](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read#leanpub-auto-a-pull-of-the-lever-prefaces)* as an approach to **Functional Programming**. Read the book and support the writer!

Note: **Jest** has been used for testing, you can install it executing ```npm install``` on this repo. To run the tests, execute ```npm test```.
